WARNING: If you use https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa[mraa],
you need to run as root. No way around this at the moment; libmraa
must have root privileges in order to diddle the pins.

WARNING: If you're working on an Edison, be prepared to wait at
startup. Especially the first time you run boot, a raft of maven jars
will be downloaded and installed in your local maven repo
(`~/.m2/repository`).  This takes many minutes. It only happens the
first time.
